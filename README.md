I tried to write a python script for creating an automated system that monitors competitors' LinkedIn activity,
specifically targeting decision-makers' new connections. Based on the 'About Us' section, job description, or recent posts of these new connections, the automation should generate a hyper-personalized connection request to be sent from an account. For a better personalized message, I've used NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) in the "generate function" and I've explained all the functions I've created in the script and also mentioned the python libraries used in the script with their respective functions. 
LinkedIn account. 
**Code Explanation:
In the header opart of the script, all the necessary libraries and modules are imported.

The "login" function logs into the LinkedIn account using the username and password. It opens the LinkedIn login page, fills in the login credentials, and clicks the login button.

The "scrape_new_connections" function navigates to the LinkedIn connections page and fetches the names of the new connections of competitor decision-makers. It uses web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup to extract the required data.

The" scrape_profile" function takes a connection name as input, searches for that connection on LinkedIn, and retrieves their profile information and job description. It uses web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup to extract the data from the connection's profile page.

The "generate_message" function takes the profile information and job description as input. A small upgradation has been by using the NLP techniques using NLTK to tokenize the sentences, tokenize the words, remove stopwords, calculate word frequencies, and generate a personalized connection request message based on the most frequent keywords. In the main.py the message is simply generated whereas In this updated version, NLTK is imported, and the generate_message function has been modified. It tokenizes the sentences in the profile information and job description, filters out stopwords, calculates word frequencies, and generates a message using the most frequent keywords.

The "send_connection_request" function takes a connection name and a personalized message as input. It searches for the connection on LinkedIn, clicks the "Connect" button, adds a note to the connection request, fills in the personalized message, and sends the connection request.

The main function is the main entry point of the script. It sets the LinkedIn credentials, calls the login function, scrapes the new connections, analyzes the connections' profiles, generates personalized messages, and sends connection requests.
Lastly, the script executes the main function if it is being run directly.

**LIBRARIES USED IN THE SCRIPT:
BeautifulSoup (Beautiful Soup):
BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for web scraping.
In this script, it is used to extract data from LinkedIn's web pages, such as connection names, profile information, and job descriptions.

Selenium:
Selenium is a popular Python library for automating web browsers.
It provides a convenient API for interacting with web pages, filling out forms, clicking buttons, and more.
In this script, it is used to automate actions on the LinkedIn website, such as logging in, searching for connections, and sending connection requests.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
NLTK is a comprehensive library for natural language processing (NLP) in Python.
It provides various tools, algorithms, and resources for text processing and analysis.
In this script, NLTK is used for sentence tokenization, word tokenization, stopword removal, and frequency analysis to generate personalized connection request messages.

Requests:
The Requests library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests.
While not explicitly used in the provided script, it is a commonly used library for web scraping and interacting with web APIs.

ChromeDriver:
ChromeDriver is a web driver provided by the Chromium project for controlling Google Chrome browser programmatically.
It is used to configure and initialize the Selenium WebDriver for controlling the Chrome browser.
